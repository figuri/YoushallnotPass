### -*Coding with JavaScript*-

Included in this repository is a web application that will randomly generate a password for you. All you have to do is click the button and follow the prompts. Many times while making this code work I could not figure out what to do next. 
However I started to peice together the process, it seems very intuitive to me.
The code included in this repository is as streamline as I could make it. If you want to examine the code check out the assets folder!

### -*Iterations*-

I struggled mostly with adding the iterations needed to add condtions that needed to be met when a user specifies what they want their password to include. UNTILLLLL
I realized that it makes sense, I just needed to set it so that the value of the 'password' would increment with every possible character value in each given type, so I just inputted each letter for lower/upper case and ever number and every symbol.
